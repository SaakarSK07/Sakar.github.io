									<p>I am a Data Analyst with over four years of diverse industry experience across multiple domains, including marketing, healthcare, and e-commerce. My expertise lies in data analysis, visualization, business requirements gathering, documentation, and business system analysis.
									I recently completed my Master’s in Business Analytics from the University of Maryland and hold a Bachelor’s in Healthcare Administration with a minor in Management. Additionally, I have a Google Data Analytics certification and a certification in Applied Business.
									My professional journey began as a Research Assistant at the University of Minnesota. Over the years, I have gained valuable experience working across different industries, honing my skills in various analytics tools such as Python, SQL, R, Tableau, and Power BI. I have extensive hands-on experience in both Waterfall and Agile-Scrum frameworks.

									My professional experience also includes working as a Data Consultant at the University of Maryland Libraries, where I improved data-driven decision-making by developing dashboards and reports. Additionally, as a Marketing Analyst and Business Developer at Kneewell, LLC, I optimized sales performance through data analysis.
									My commitment to excellence and passion for leveraging data for informed decision-making make me a valuable asset to any team.
									Outside of my professional life, I am a huge football and Manchester United fan. In my free time, I enjoy playing FIFA.</p>
